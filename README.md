# COVID-19 Monthly Deaths Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to the COVID-19 Monthly Deaths Visualization project! This repository explores and visualizes monthly average deaths in the United States, focusing on the impact of the virus throughout the year.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis, "avg_deaths.csv," contains information on monthly average deaths. The data includes details on the number of new deaths each month, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the pandemic's impact.

## Visualizations

The main script, `visualize_deaths.py`, creates a set of visualizations showcasing the average number of new deaths per month. The script uses the matplotlib and pandas libraries to generate insightful line plots, highlighting specific periods and key statistics.

## Reproducing the Analysis

To reproduce the analysis on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID19-Monthly-Deaths.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd COVID19-Monthly-Deaths`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the visualization script: `python visualize_deaths.py`

This will generate the visualizations and save them as "storytelling.jpg" in the project directory.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
